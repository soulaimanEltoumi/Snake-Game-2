# Snake Game

## Description

The Snake Game is a classic snake game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, you control a snake that must eat food to grow. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/snake-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd snake-game
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

### Controls

- Use the arrow keys (⬆️ ⬇️ ⬅️ ➡️) to move the snake up, down, left, or right.

### Gameplay

1. Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
2. Guide the snake to eat the food that appears on the board.
3. The snake will grow longer each time it eats food, and your score will increase.
4. Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body to prevent the game from ending.

5. The game will end when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

6. Your final score will be displayed on the screen.
